          I’m a technically grounded Product Manager and Software Engineer with a focus on building user-first, scalable solutions. With experience at organizations like Epic Games and the United Nations, I’ve led end-to-end product development — from defining roadmaps and running user research to architecting backend systems and optimizing interfaces.
          My background in engineering enables me to work seamlessly with developers, while my product mindset ensures we're always solving the right problems.
          Currently pursuing a Master's in Information Management at the University of Washington, I bring clarity, curiosity, and execution to every stage of the product lifecycle.
