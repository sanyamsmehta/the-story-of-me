        <p className="text-lg text-foreground leading-relaxed mb-6">
          I'm a technically grounded Product Manager and Software Engineer with a focus on building user-first, scalable solutions. With experience at organizations like Epic Games and the United Nations, I've led end-to-end product development â€” from defining roadmaps and running user research to architecting backend systems and optimizing interfaces.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg text-foreground leading-relaxed mb-6">
          My background in engineering enables me to work seamlessly with developers, while my product mindset ensures we're always solving the right problems.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg text-foreground leading-relaxed">
          Currently pursuing a Master's in Information Management at the University of Washington, I bring clarity, curiosity, and execution to every stage of the product lifecycle.
