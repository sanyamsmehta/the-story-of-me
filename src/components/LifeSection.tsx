          There are a few things that I live for- Driving, Golf, Chai, and the company of my close ones. 
          I also admire Messi for making me fall in Love with Football.

          I have travelled to over 25 countries and I speak 5 languages fluently. I have lived in 3 different countries. 
          I am extremely extroverted. The Office is one of my favorite TV shows and it has helped me through some tough times.

          My favorite book is Man's search for Meaning and I strongly believe that work is what leads a person to happiness. 
          I am a staunch believer of Stoicism. I am religious too and have been on several religious pilgrimages within my country and outside.
        </p>

          I studied in a Christian School for 14 years, lived in the middle east which was for 2 years and now live in the states 
          where people from all around the world reside. This gave me exposure to so many cultures, religions, languages, and perspectives.
        </p>
        <p>
          I love meeting new people and knowing their life story. My family and my close friends are who I go to when I need clarity.
